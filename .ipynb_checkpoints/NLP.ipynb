      "Generated Summary: The new Club Suite offers a fair amount of privacy, especially with the screen door closed, and includes direct aisle access. When fully reclined, the seat converts into a fairly spacious bed, although I found the surface on the side a bit hard and uncomfortable to sleep on. The catering on board was fairly good and tasty - the appetizers and the main course were generally well cooked, although the cabin crew were very slow with the meal service. Upon arrival at Heathrow, passengers had to wait over 90 minutes for checked baggage to arrive. Only negative was the food on the SFO/LHR leg. The advertised filet steak was more akin to stewing steak and was inedible. Sadly this is not the only occasion I have food on US/UK flights to be sub standard. Otherwise happy to recommend BA. We have just returned from Iceland and our experience was one of the worst we have ever had with BA. Again our flight was just cancelled due to operational reasons but what made matters worse on this occasion was the flight was quite early at 7:45am. We went to bed at around 11pm (night before), checked the flight and it showed as being on time with again no issues being reported so we went to sleep fairly rest assured the the flight would be fine. We woke up at 5:30am and then discovered our flight had been cancelled without any warning! We were then left with virtually no other return flight options for that day. It soon got worse as the earliest flight option then being offered by BA was 3 days later! We opted to choose Tuesday with BA as we were left with no other option! If we hadn't acted quickly the Tuesday availability was sure to sell out leaving us with a return option of Wednesday onwards having experienced the same problem with BA in Zurich back in December. We were lucky on that occasion as BA offered several flights back on the same day in Zurich but this wasn't the case with Iceland. Our hotel in Iceland was very limited and then left in a predicament as limited hotel availability then left us in a very short notice. Our car was fully booked and our hotel had to be returned to airport and our car was returned to the airport. This was not ideal as our journey into Oslo was 8 hours but it went via Oslo and a total of 8 hours. Assessing our options we came across another airline and after searching for any options we decided to get us back to the UK sooner with another airline. After a good half hour of searching we were able to find a flight in Heathrow which came across in an hour and a half. We came across a good flight in a good hour and after half an hour we were back in the UK. We are very happy with BA and have had overall good service from them however more recently we have experienced flight delays, operational issues, flight cancellations, poor check-in experiences etc. It was a very frustrating end to what was otherwise a fairly enjoyable trip in Club World, and left a very poor last impression of BA. The guy on the LHR/SFO leg was exceptional and I regret that I have forgotten his name, and he was exceptional. The only negative was that the advertisedfilet steak on the LHR leg was more like stewing steak and was more like stewing steak and was inelegant than what I had been served on the flight to Vancouver and Vacation to London on the same day. The restaurant in Vegas was very good and served a small breakfast, which contained a croissant, a small egg and bacon sandwich, and a mango puree. The portions were incredibly small - the chicken dish contained maybe 5 pieces of chicken, 2 pieces of broccoli and a piece of unknown food. The real let down was the snack before landing in Vancouver was a bizarre tasting chicken pastry wrap, which didn't have much chicken and did not taste at all like a pastry, and was too sweet, too mushy, and too salty. The seats, although not exactly spacious, were tolerable, but the aisles are very narrow, and cabin crew and other passengers frequently bumped into me while walking up and down the aisles. It took more than 3 hours after departure from Vancouver for the meal to be completed. The first meal service was very slow, more than three hours to serve the meal. The food on this flight was generally good, and BA's catering on this trip was generally good. The service was generally responsive to passengers' request, and once or twice during the flight, and came down the aisle with drinks. It wasn't the best of BA's World Traveler product and catering leaves much to be desired. I certainly cannot recommend BA for a trip to Canada and the United States. It's a great way to see Canada and New Zealand.\n"
